Because it’s a producing area, some catches can be eaten raw on the same day they are landed.\n- Recommended local items also include local octopus, shellfish like turban shell (sazae), and Shonan shirasu.\n- “Himodori katsuo” (day-return bonito), known for a chewy texture, is highlighted as a luxury seasonal specialty available from summer to autumn.\n- Seaweeds (nori, wakame, kombu, hijiki, etc.) are described as top-quality in freshness, color, aroma, texture, and flavor.\n- **Produce highlights (Daichi no Megumi / “Bounty of the Land”)**\n- “Yokosuka vegetables” are characterized by natural sweetness, influenced by mineral-rich soils and sunlight, with freshness that makes the difference noticeable.\n- Representative items include cabbage, daikon radish, and pumpkin. Seasonal examples:\n- Spring: potatoes, onions\n- Summer: watermelon, cucumber, tomato, eggplant\n- Autumn: mandarin oranges (mikan), sweet potatoes\n- Winter: strawberries, napa cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli\n- “Early-spring cabbage” is described as sweet and tender despite being harvested in winter; “spring cabbage” becomes even sweeter and is recommended for raw dishes like salads.\n- Yokosuka also produces colorful, unusual Western vegetables used in Italian/French cuisine, emphasizing diversity, vibrant colors, and high quality.\n- Local eggs, meat, and milk are mentioned, and sweets made with local eggs are suggested as ideal souvenirs.\n- **Where to try/buy**\n- The page introduces city-registered “local production for local consumption” shops (restaurants, lodging facilities, processed food sellers, supermarkets, retailers, and direct-sale outlets) that actively handle local products so visitors can “taste” and “buy” Yokosuka’s local ingredients.\n\nAttention:\n- Seasonality matters: availability and peak taste vary by season (especially bonito in summer–autumn and produce by season).\n- Fresh seafood may be served raw only when conditions are right; follow each shop’s guidance and any food safety notes.\n- Check shop hours/stock in advance if you are visiting specifically for a seasonal item.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/gourmet/yokosuka_localfoods.html\n- (Related on-page references) “Yokosuka Umi no Sachi / Daichi no Megumi” local production & consumption guidebook (web version) and the city’s “local production for local consumption” shop listings.\n\nTags: Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japanese local food, Seafood, Local produce, Seasonal specialties, Farm-to-table, Shirasu, Bonito, Yokosuka vegetables"

It was produced by the U.S. Navy Yokosuka Base (home to about 20,000 Americans) and the recipe was provided on November 18, 2009.\n- Compared with typical “New York cheesecake” in Japan, it uses a generous amount of cream cheese for a rich, creamy taste and features a fragrant graham-cracker crust.\n- The “cherry” topping represents Japan’s iconic sakura and symbolizes Japan–U.S. friendship, giving the dessert its name “Cherry Cheese Cake.”\n- Key points highlighted in the report:\n- High-quality cream cheese is the star ingredient.\n- Because it is simple (few additional ingredients), the flavor becomes especially dense and rich.\n- New York–style baking uses a water bath and low temperature to steam-bake it slowly, aiming for a creamy finish.\n- A lightly sweet cherry topping is simmered carefully until it thickens, leaving a refreshing aftertaste.\n\nAttention:\n- This is a rich, dairy-heavy dessert. If you have allergies (dairy, wheat/gluten from graham crackers), confirm ingredients with each shop.\n- Availability and serving style may differ by store—check before visiting, especially on busy weekends/holidays.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/gourmet/cherrycheesecake.html\n\nTags: yokosuka, kanagawa, gourmet, dessert, cheesecake, new-york-style, cherry, sakura, japan-us-friendship, local-brand"

The city promotes it so visitors can enjoy an authentic “American-style” burger at participating shops around the base area.\n- **Why Yokosuka:** Yokosuka has long been a gateway for American culture through the U.S. Navy presence. The report notes that hamburgers became widely familiar in Yokosuka, and the city is considered one of the places where hamburgers first took root in Japan.\n- **Origin story (local branding):**\n- A traditional Navy burger recipe—popular at base open-house events—was officially provided to Yokosuka City on **November 19, 2008**, as a symbol of friendship and joint local revitalization efforts.\n- **Taste & style (key characteristics):**\n- Extremely simple, **focused on the natural flavor of beef**.\n- Uses **100% beef with a high lean ratio**, cooked simply so it tastes like “steak in a bun.”\n- Topped with **fresh onion and tomato**.\n- You season it yourself with **ketchup and mustard**, in a classic American style.\n- TSUNAMI / TSUNAMI BOX\n- Dobuita Shokudo “Perry”\n- Hungry’s\n- Younger Than\n- HONEY BEE (including the Yokosuka Port Market shop)\n- LAUNA (local gourmet restaurant)\n- YOKOSUKA Shell\n- HONCH SHELL\n- Grill & Cafe Alfred\n- SURF TACO\n\nAttention:\n- The “Navy Burger” style is intentionally simple—don’t expect heavy sauces or many toppings by default.\n- Some of the most “authentic” experiences are associated with **U.S. Navy base public open days**, but the city also promotes burgers sold at **restaurants outside the base** around the base area.\n- Check each restaurant’s opening hours, menu availability, and access conditions (especially on event days).\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/gourmet/yokosuka_navyburger.html\n\nTags: yokosuka, kanagawa, local-gourmet, navy-burger, american-culture, dobuita-street, shioiri, 100-percent-beef"

Perry\n\nPlace:\n- Perry Park (Perry Kōen), Kurihama, Yokosuka City, Kanagawa, Japan\n- Address: 7-14 Kurihama, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 239-0831\n\nDetail:\n- **Why it’s worth visiting:** Perry Park marks the moment Japan’s “opening to the world” accelerated. Inside the park stands the **Perry Landing Monument**, built to commemorate Commodore **Matthew Calbraith Perry** landing at Kurihama Beach on July 14, 1853 and delivering the U.S. President’s letter requesting Japan to open the country.\n- **What to see:**\n- **Perry Landing Monument** (the monument’s inscription is attributed to the calligraphy of **Hirobumi Ito**).\n- **Perry Memorial Museum** (inside the park): exhibits historical materials and models related to Perry’s arrival.\n- **Jōkisen Monument**: a witty poem/pun comparing the shock of “four cups of tea that keep you awake” with the shock of “four steamships arriving,” capturing how startling the “Black Ships” appeared to people at the time.\n- **Scenery note:** The coastline once had a well-known beach; later land reclamation and industrial development changed the shoreline. From the remaining sandy area, you can still see the **Tokyo Wan Ferry** route and large industrial structures offshore.\n\nAttention:\n- **Admission:** Free.\n- **Access (public transport):** From **Keikyū Kurihama Station**, take a bus bound for **Nobi Kaigan** (~10 minutes) and get off at **“Perry Kinenhi”** bus stop.\n- **Parking:** None.\n- **Accessibility (summary):** No elevator/escalator; slope measures at the entrance are available, but wheelchair-accessible toilets and several other barrier-free facilities are not available.\n- **Rules:** Use of drones and similar devices is **not permitted** in the park.\n- **Contact:** Perry Memorial Museum +81-46-834-7531\n\nLink:\n- Yokosuka tourism page: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/perry-park.html\n- Official park site: http://www.kanagawaparks.com/kurihama-perry/perry/\n\nTags: Yokosuka, Kurihama, Perry Park, Japanese history, Black Ships, Monument, Museum, Waterfront walk"

With 11-car trains, some cars stop inside a tunnel, so certain doors do not open.\n- On the Yokosuka Station side of JR Taura Station, three adjacent tunnels from three eras can be seen from the station overpass: the oldest (down line) completed in 1889 (Meiji era), a brick-built tunnel added in 1924 (Taisho era) for double-tracking, and the largest tunnel built in 1943 (Showa era) for wartime military freight.\n- The area name is historically “Shikkama” (literally “lost sickle”), and the tunnel name is said to use the homophone “Shikkama” written as “Shikkama / Shikkama (Seven Kettles)” to avoid the unlucky association of “losing a boiler (kama)” for steam locomotives.\n\nAttention:\n- No parking is available.\n- Accessibility support is very limited (e.g., no elevators/escalators; wheelchair-accessible toilet and other related facilities are not available).\n- When boarding/alighting, follow station guidance because some doors may remain closed due to the short platform.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/taura-st.html\n\nTags: yokosuka, taura, railway, tunnel, history, architecture, meiji, taisho, showa, trainspotting"

Miurafuji is not a very high mountain, but the summit offers wide-open views. On clear days, you can see from Sagami Bay all the way to Tokyo Bay, and even Izu Oshima and the Boso Peninsula.\n- With good luck, you may also spot Mt. Fuji appearing grandly above Mt. Takeyama.\n- From the summit area, you can overlook the full view of “Hikari-no-Oka” at YRP (Yokosuka Research Park), a cluster of mobile communications R&D institutes.\n- A hiking route is maintained that links Tsukuihama → Mt. Miurafuji → Hodaiyama → Mt. Takeyama.\n- Cultural note: A Sengen Shrine (Oku-miya) is enshrined at the summit, with a stone monument carved “Sengen Shrine Oku-miya.” Historically, fishermen used Mt. Miurafuji and Mt. Takeyama as landmarks to locate fishing grounds and identify the direction back to port, connecting the mountain to faith in big catches and maritime safety.\n\nAttention:\n- Water facilities are available at the Mt. Takeyama summit toilet (not necessarily at Mt. Miurafuji itself).\n- No parking is available—public transportation is recommended.\n- Accessibility: The site is not barrier-free (no elevators/escalators/ramps; no wheelchair-accessible toilet; no wheelchair rental; no diaper-changing or universal sheet; no accessible parking; no guiding blocks).\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/miurafuzi.html\n\nTags: #Yokosuka #Kanagawa #MiuraPeninsula #Hiking #Trail #ScenicView #MtMiurafuji #Nature #SengenShrine #YRP"

Following WWII, parts such as the guns, masts, and bridge were removed by order of the occupation forces, but the ship was later restored to its current form in **1961** with donations and support including from the U.S. Navy.\n- **What to see onboard:** Exhibits include Imperial Japanese Navy uniforms/equipment, Russo-Japanese War materials, and restored rooms (e.g., the Commander-in-Chief’s room, Chief of Staff room, Captain’s room). At the conning tower, footprints mark the spot where Admiral Togo is said to have stood for five hours during the Battle of the Sea of Japan.\n- **Key ship specs (quick facts):** Displacement 15,140 tons; length 132 m; beam 23 m; speed 18 knots; crew 860; main guns 4 × 30 cm; secondary 14 × 15 cm; 20 × 8 cm; 4 × 45 cm torpedo tubes.\n- **Admission:** 600 JPY (adults), 300 JPY (high school students), free (elementary & junior high students).\n- **Opening hours:**\n- Apr–Sep: 09:00–17:30\n- Mar & Oct: 09:00–17:00\n- Nov–Feb: 09:00–16:30\n- **Closed:** Dec 28–31\n- **Access:**\n- From Keikyu **Yokosuka-Chuo Station**: ~15 min on foot, or take the Mikasa loop bus and get off at “Mikasa Park.”\n- From JR **Yokosuka Station**: take a bus toward Yokosuka-Chuo area (~10 min), get off at “Otaki-cho,” then ~7 min walk.\n- By car: from Yokohama-Yokosuka Road **Yokosuka IC**, follow Prefectural Route 28 to Route 16, then turn left at the Mikasa Park entrance.\n- **Parking (Mikasa Park parking, 42 spaces):** 410 JPY up to 1 hour; +210 JPY per 30 minutes up to 2 hours; after 2 hours, 830 JPY plus +100 JPY per additional hour (up to 1 hour increments).\n\nAttention:\n- **Accessibility notes (important):**\n- No elevator / no escalator.\n- Step-free entry measures (including a slope/ramp) are available.\n- Wheelchair rental is available, but **wheelchair users must enter via the forward entrance on the middle deck (1F)** and **cannot move to the upper deck (2F)**.\n- Wheelchair-accessible toilets are **not available** (also no ostomate-ready toilets, no baby diaper-changing sheet, and no adult universal changing sheet).\n- **Plan around closures:** The ship is **closed Dec 28–31**, so avoid year-end dates.\n- **Crowd/comfort tip:** Winter hours end earlier (16:30), so arrive with enough time if visiting Nov–Feb.\n\nLink:\n- Yokosuka City Tourism Info: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/mikasa.html\n- Official site: http://www.kinenkan-mikasa.or.jp/\n\nTags: #Yokosuka, #MemorialShipMikasa, #MikasaPark, #HistoricShip, #NavalHistory, #RussoJapaneseWar, #HeihachiroTogo, #Museum, #Kanagawa, #JapanHeritage, #Accessibility"

Each emplacement originally held two howitzers.\n- The emplacements are bowl-shaped, and underground you can still see brick-walled, concrete-ceilinged protected rooms (bombproof shelters) and ammunition magazines.\n- Surviving features include a shell-hoist shaft used to supply shells to the guns and an internal water supply/drainage system.\n- Because it preserves its original construction well and is important for understanding modern Japanese military and fortification technology, the site was designated a National Historic Site in 2015. It is also recognized as a component cultural asset of Japan Heritage.\n\nAttention:\n- Opening days: Saturdays, Sundays, and Japanese public holidays (closed Dec 29–Jan 3).\n- Opening hours:\n- Oct–Feb: 09:30–15:30 (last entry 15:00)\n- Mar–Sep: 09:30–16:30 (last entry 16:00)\n- Temporary closure may occur during severe weather (heavy rain, flooding, strong winds), typhoons, snowfall, or other unsafe conditions.\n- No vehicles (including bicycles and motorbikes) may enter or park inside the site. Use nearby parking areas (including paid parking) and walk in.\n- Accessibility: Barrier-free facilities are not provided (e.g., no elevator/escalator, no step-free entrance measures, and no wheelchair-accessible restroom).\n\nLink:\n- Tourism information page: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/Chiyogasakihoudai.html\n- Yokosuka City page (opening information): https://www.city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp/8120/bunkazai/chiyogasaki-koukai.html\n\nTags: yokosuka, kanagawa, uraga, historic site, coastal fort, meiji era, military heritage, outdoor, walking, japan heritage"

Tradition holds that, as Kinugasa Castle neared collapse, members of the Miura clan escaped via a back route to this area, then sailed toward Awa (Bōsō Peninsula). The toponym **“Funakura”** (“boat storehouse/harbor”) remains as a trace of where boats were hidden or moored.\n- **Fortification & terrain:** The castle reportedly took advantage of natural landforms—described as steep and difficult to approach on three sides, with a single route opening toward the sea—making it a highly defensible position.\n- **Archaeology & designation:** Today the area is protected as a Kanagawa Prefecture–designated historic site, **“Ruins centered on the Yoshii Shell Midden.”** Excavations identified multiple shell-midden locations and settlement traces spanning the Jōmon period and later eras, with the broader plateau also considered the likely location of the late-Heian mountain castle.\n\nAttention:\n- **No parking** on site.\n- **Access:** About a **20-minute walk** from **Keikyu Kurihama Station** or **JR Kurihama Station**.\n- **Barrier-free:** Facilities are largely unavailable (no elevator/escalator/ramps; no accessible toilet; no wheelchair rental; no diaper-changing/universal sheet; no designated accessible parking; no tactile guidance blocks).\n- As an archaeological/historic area, please respect signs, surrounding residences, and the landscape.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/nutazyoushi.html\n- Yokosuka Tourist Information Center (09:30–17:00): +81-46-822-8301\n\nTags: yokosuka, kanagawa, castle-ruins, miura-clan, samurai-history, archaeology, jomon-period, shell-midden, historic-site, walk-from-station"

The back of the monument lists crew members’ names, including Katsu Kaishu (captain), Yukichi Fukuzawa, and John Manjiro.\n- The park also features a poem monument related to Tekkan and Akiko Yosano, and it offers a scenic view overlooking Uraga Port from within the grounds.\n\nAttention:\n- Parking: none.\n- Access: From Keikyu “Uraga Station,” take a bus bound for Kurihama, get off at “Konyamachi,” then walk about 10 minutes.\n- Accessibility (barrier-free): the report indicates no elevator, escalator, ramp/step-free entrance measures, wheelchair-accessible toilets, ostomate toilets, wheelchair rental, diaper-changing sheets, universal changing table, accessible parking, or tactile guidance blocks.\n- Drones and similar devices are not permitted inside the park.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/atagoyama.html\n- Official city facility page: https://www.city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp/5560/sisetu/fc00000979.html\n\nTags: yokosuka, uraga, kanagawa, park, history, cultural-heritage, monument, kanrin-maru, viewpoint, literature"

The region then maintains and uses a group of tangible and intangible cultural properties to share the story strategically and revitalize the area.\n- The story highlighted here explains how, in the Meiji period, Japan urgently needed coastal defense capabilities to compete with Western powers. As a national project, four natural good harbors were selected and developed into naval ports. People and cutting-edge technologies gathered in previously quiet farming and fishing villages, and infrastructure such as waterworks and railways rapidly developed alongside naval institutions—creating four naval-port cities that drove Japan’s modernization.\n- Even more than a century later, many facilities remain in operation, and these former naval-port cities still attract visitors with their “somewhat nostalgic yet resilient” atmosphere.\n- Yokosuka’s Japan Heritage-related constituent cultural properties include sites such as the Chiyogasaki Battery Ruins (recognized as part of the Japan Heritage narrative).\n- A past tourism-related event example: On January 19, 2019, a photo session collaborating with “Sukajan” (a fashion item that originated in Yokosuka) was held at the Second Battery of the Kannonsaki Battery Ruins. The page encourages visitors to view local high school students’ photos and visit the battery ruins (about a 10-minute walk from the Yokosuka Museum of Art).\n- Another past tourism initiative mentioned: a “Goshuin Cycle Rally” tied to the simultaneous special opening of two major sacred sites on the Miura Peninsula, including public release of VR images.\n\nAttention:\n- Some related facilities may still be active or have access restrictions; confirm current visiting rules and opening conditions on the official site before you go.\n- For specific event information (past events, VR content, rally details), refer to the official “Past Event Details” sections on the source site.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/nihonisan/\n\nTags: #JapanHeritage, #Yokosuka, #Kanagawa, #MiuraPeninsula, #Modernization, #NavalPortHistory, #CoastalDefense, #CulturalHeritage"

A local custom mentioned in the guide is to place a magatama charm from West Kano Shrine inside a protective pouch from East Kano Shrine to support good relationships (including romance).\n- Historically, the enshrined deity is Emperor Ōjin (the same as Iwashimizu Hachimangū in Kyoto). The shrine is said to have begun on August 15, 1181, when the monk Mongaku invited the spirit of Iwashimizu Hachimangū while praying for the revival of the Genji; later, Minamoto no Yoritomo’s success led to the name “Kano Daimyōjin.”\n- The wooded hill behind the shrine is Myojin-yama (about 50 meters high). It has an inner shrine (okumiya) near the summit and a marker for “Kaishū Katsu’s fasting place.”\n- The Myojin-yama area is valued for its well-preserved natural forest and biodiversity; the ubamegashi (Quercus phillyraeoides) here is noted as a northern distribution limit in the prefecture. The grove is designated as a Prefectural Natural Monument (“Kano Shrine Shaso-rin”).\n\nAttention:\n- Accessibility: the site lists no elevator/escalator and no ramp/slope measures, and indicates that the route from the “Shinmachi” bus stop includes stairs.\n- Parking is limited to 10 cars.\n\nLink:\n- Yokosuka tourism page: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/higashi-kanou-z.html\n- Official site: http://jinjya.net\n\nTags: yokosuka, uraga, shrine, kano-shrine, history-and-culture, power-spot, myojinyama, komainu, ferry-crossing"

It has long been worshiped across the Miura Peninsula since at least the Edo period, especially as a shrine for matchmaking and safe voyages.\n- A well-known local rite is to dedicate a *bottomless ladle* (a ladle with the bottom removed) tied with hemp. This custom expresses prayers for safe childbirth—“as water drains out, may the birth go smoothly”—and is held on March 3.\n- During the festival, Shinto priests and shrine maidens board a boat from Ashina Beach in front of the shrine and perform a “floating hina dolls” ritual (nagashi-bina).\n- The west coast area of Yokosuka has several related spots connected with safe childbirth and matchmaking, such as Junisho Shrine and Akiya’s “Kosan-ishi” (Childbirth Stone).\n- Access (public transit): From Keikyu Shin-Zushi Station, take a bus toward Nagai (e.g., bound for Yokosuka City Hospital or Nagai; about 25 minutes). Get off at “Ashina” bus stop, then walk about 15 minutes.\n\nAttention:\n- No parking available on site.\n- Barrier-free facilities are limited (e.g., no elevators/escalators, no wheelchair-accessible toilets).

Plan accordingly if you need step-free access.\n- Access by bus: from Keikyu Misakiguchi Station, take the “Arasaki” bus (~30 min), get off at “Urushiyama,” then walk about 5 minutes.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/kumano-z.html\n- Phone: +81-46-857-7177\n\nTags: Yokosuka, Nagai, Arasaki, Shrine, History, Cultural heritage, Kumano faith, Accessibility"

It was built in 1648 by order of the shogunate, and its rapeseed-oil lamp was said to be visible up to about 4 nautical miles (7.4 km) offshore.\n- From the Genroku era onward, it was maintained at the expense of East Uraga's dried-sardine (hoshi-iwashi) wholesalers. It reportedly operated every day for about 220 years, protecting the shipping route until it was abolished in 1872.\n- The original structure remained into the 1880s but later collapsed due to weather, leaving only the stone base. In 1988, the current building was reconstructed on the remaining stonework to match the historical exterior.\n- A small sandy beach stretches from Tomyodo, and you can still see many vessels passing offshore today.\n- Admission: Free.\n- Access: From Keikyu Uraga Station, take a bus bound for Keikyu Kurihama Station via Chiyogasaki (about 8 minutes). Get off at “Tomyodo Iriguchi” bus stop, then walk about 5 minutes.\n- Parking: Nearby “Tomyodo Green Space” parking is available.\n- Contact: Yokosuka Tourist Information Center (Tel: +81-46-822-8301, 9:30–17:00).\n\nAttention:\n- Accessibility (barrier-free): Not well equipped. No elevator or escalator, and no slope/step-free entrance measures are listed. No accessible toilet, no ostomate toilet, no wheelchair rental, no diaper-changing sheet, and no universal (adult) changing sheet. There is one dedicated parking space for people with disabilities, but no guidance blocks are listed.\n- If you need step-free access or accessible restrooms, plan accordingly and consider checking the latest conditions before visiting.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/toumyoudou.html\n\nTags: Yokosuka, Uraga, Tomyodo, lighthouse, historic site, coastal walk, free admission, Kanagawa"

Rivers such as the **Miyama River** and **Ōyato River** are thought to have functioned as natural defensive lines.\n- The site is closely tied to the **Battle of Kinugasa (1180)**, when a much larger Taira (Heike) force attacked the Miura defenders—an episode connected to the opening era of the Kamakura period.\n- Today it is mainly enjoyed as a **short historical hike / walk**, with points of interest including:\n- **“Uma-kaeshi no Saka” (Horse-turning Slope):** a notably steep ascent on the route toward the main area.\n- **Fudō Waterfall (Fudō no Taki):** a spring/water spot below Daizen-ji, linked to a local legend and considered important for daily and defensive water use.\n- **Momiiwa (Lookout Rock):** a large boulder said to have been used to observe and direct the battle; artifacts were reportedly found nearby during early 20th‑century site works.\n- **Yatake bamboo (arrow bamboo):** bamboo historically used as arrow material; the surrounding “Yabe” place-name is associated with arrow-making traditions.\n- **Seki Jizō (Cough Jizō):** a small Jizō statue tied to a story from the battle; locally associated with relief from coughs.\n- **Karamete-guchi (rear gate route):** a narrow cut-through path said to have been heavily defended; nearby are traces of earthworks, training-ground areas, and old wells.\n\nAttention:\n- **No parking available.**\n- The route inside the historic area is **unpaved** and includes **steep slopes and stairs**—wear shoes with good grip and allow extra time.\n- Barrier-free facilities are essentially **not available** (e.g., no elevators/escalators; no wheelchair-accessible toilets or rentals).

    "place": "West Kano Shrine (Nishi Kano Jinja)\nAddress: 1-1-13 Nishi-Uraga, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 239-0824, Japan",
    "text": "Title: West Kano Shrine (Nishi Kano Jinja) — Uraga, Yokosuka (Kanagawa, Japan)\n\nDatetime:\n- 12/26/25, 8:39 PM (page capture timestamp)\n\nPlace:\n- West Kano Shrine (Nishi Kano Jinja)\n- Address: 1-1-13 Nishi-Uraga, Yokosuka, Kanagawa 239-0824, Japan\n\nDetail:\n- **Overview / origin:** The shrine is associated with the title “Kano Myojin” (“the deity that grants wishes”). Tradition says the monk Mongaku prayed for the revival of the Minamoto clan by enshrining (inviting) the spirit of Iwashimizu Hachimangu; after the wish was fulfilled, the shrine received the title “Kano Myojin.” It is said to have begun in 1181, and the enshrined deity is Emperor Ojin (as with Iwashimizu Hachimangu).\n- **Architecture & craftsmanship:** The current shrine building was rebuilt in 1842 (after a loss in 1837). A major highlight is the extremely elaborate interior decoration, including more than 230 carvings around the shrine precincts, attributed to the Awa sculptor Goto Rihei. Look for the coffered ceiling carvings of flowers and birds (including motifs believed not to have existed in Japan at the time), and try to find the hidden wrestler figure said to be supporting a ridgepost.\n- **Komainu (guardian dogs):** The komainu in front of the shrine appear to have open mouths on both sides. There is also a “hidden” cute komainu—partly concealed near a pillar—so keep an eye out.\n- **Plaster relief art (Kote-e):** At the entrance of the shrine office, there is a white relief decoration made with trowel-and-plaster technique (“kote-e”). It is said to be a work from 1930 (Showa 5) by Ishikawa Zenkichi, a nationally known master of plaster craft (“Miura no Zenkichi”).\n- **Power-spot style visit:** The shrine is popular as a “wish-granting” spot. A local practice says that if you place West Kano Shrine’s magatama (comma-shaped jewel) into the amulet pouch from East Kano Shrine and carry it with you, it may help bring good relationships (including romance). The East and West Kano Shrines are connected by the “Uraga no Watashi” ferry that crosses Uraga harbor.\n- **Festival culture:** A tiger dance (Tora Odori), designated as an intangible folk cultural property, is offered at the annual festival in September and is said to have been passed down locally since 1720.\n- **Nearby historical notes:** A monument commemorates Emperor Meiji resting here on May 18, 1881, when he came to observe the construction progress of the Kannonzaki battery.\n\nAttention:\n- **Hours:** 8:30–17:00 (worship/prayer is possible all day). No regular closing days.\n- **Access by transit:** From Keikyu Uraga Station, take a bus toward Kurihama Station (~5 min), get off at “Konyamachi,” then walk ~1 minute.\n- **Accessibility:** The site information indicates no elevator/escalator and no ramp/step-free entrance measures. There is no wheelchair-accessible toilet or wheelchair rental listed. The route from Konyamachi bus stop includes stairs.\n- **Suggested itinerary:** If you want to try the magatama + amulet tradition, plan to visit both West and East Kano Shrines and use the Uraga ferry connection.\n\nLink:\n- Yokosuka tourism page: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/nishi-kanou-z.html\n- Official site: https://kanoujinjya.jp/\n\nTags: #Yokosuka, #Uraga, #Shrine, #Hachiman, #History, #Carvings, #Komainu, #PowerSpot, #TigerDance, #AccessibleTravel"

The lightning struck a nearby Byakushin (juniper) tree, charring it black, yet the maidens were unharmed.\n- On Tsukishima, the Byakushin tree remains as a sacred tree. The area was once an inlet, and Tsukishima was a small island within salt fields. Behind the “Ikazuchi Shrine Former Site Monument” (built in 1931 / Shōwa 6), there used to be a small pond.\n- In the shrine precincts, a large ginkgo tree (over 500 years old) is revered; its hanging “breast-shaped” growths are objects of faith for safe childbirth and childrearing.\n\nAttention:\n- Access: From Keikyū Oppama Station, walk about 5 minutes toward Yokohama along Route 16.\n- Barrier-free notes: A ramp/step-free detour route to the main hall exists, but it is a steep slope; visiting by wheelchair requires assistance. Elevators/escalators are not available, and wheelchair-accessible toilets and other related facilities are not provided.\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/ikazuti-z.html\n- Official site: https://kaminarijinja.com/\n\nTags: yokosuka, oppama, taura, shrine, history, legend, sacred-tree, ginkgo, accessibility"

After the war, it became a municipal cemetery, and an additional area was developed for local residents who did not have their own burial plots.\n- The site covers roughly 25,000 m² of hilly terrain and is arranged in three terraced levels. The lower and middle terraces mainly contain graves of enlisted personnel, with orderly rows of headstones. The upper terrace, covered with lawn, includes seven memorial towers (cenotaphs) and graves of officers.\n- Notable memorials include cenotaphs for victims of major naval incidents and conflicts (e.g., warship disasters and wartime casualties), reflecting Yokosuka’s historical role as a core naval hub.\n- A memorial service is held every year in May.\n\nAttention:\n- Admission is free.\n- Opening hours: 08:30–17:00 (extended hours during Obon: 08:00–18:00; during the equinoctial weeks: 08:00–17:30).\n- No parking is available on site.\n- Accessibility: there is a slope that allows access up to the cemetery entrance, but elevators/escalators are not available and wheelchair-accessible toilets are not provided.\n- This is a cemetery and memorial site—please behave respectfully (quiet voices, no littering, and follow any on-site rules).\n- Contact (Yokosuka City Health General Affairs Division): Tel +81-46-824-7502 / Email hga-hd@city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp\n\nLink:\n- https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/mamonzan.html\n- http://www.city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp/3110/sisetu/fc00001136.html\n\nTags: Yokosuka, Kanagawa, History, Culture, Memorial, Navy, Cemetery, Accessible-route-to-entrance"

Takatori (Elevation: 139 m), Oppama / Taura area, Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan\n\nDetail:\n- Mt. Takatori is a 139-meter rocky mountain known for steep cliffs, sometimes nicknamed “Shonan Myogi” because its rugged silhouette resembles Mt. Myogi in Gunma.\n- On the rock face, a giant image of **Miroku Bosatsu (Maitreya Bodhisattva)** is carved directly into the cliff. It was created by Yokosuka-based sculptor **Shigeru Fujishima**, starting in 1960 (Showa 35), and took about a year to complete.\n- The carving is massive: approximately **8 m tall** and **4.5 m wide**.\n- A separate cliff-carved statue of **Shaka Nyorai (Shakyamuni Tathagata)** once existed, but it was demolished in 1965 (Showa 40) due to the construction of Takatori Elementary School.\n- The mountain’s soft tuff rock (common in Yokosuka) was historically quarried as “Takatori stone” for construction materials, which helped create the dramatic vertical rock walls seen today.\n- Numerous small holes on the rock surface are said to be traces of pitons driven in for climbing practice.\n\nAttention:\n- **No parking available.**\n- Accessibility is limited: the site is **not barrier-free** (no elevators, escalators, ramps), and there are **no wheelchair-accessible toilets**, ostomate toilets, wheelchair rentals, diaper-changing sheets, universal changing sheets, accessible parking spaces, or tactile paving blocks.\n\nLink:\n- Tourism page: https://www.cocoyoko.net/spot/magaibutu.html\n- Yokosuka City (official): http://www.city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp/5560/sisetu/fc00000978.html\n- Contact (Yokosuka City Park Management Division): Tel +81-46-822-8333 / Email pa-ep@city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp\n\nTags: yokosuka, kanagawa, takatori-yama, oppama, taura, magaibutsu, cliff-carving, buddhist-art, hiking, history"
